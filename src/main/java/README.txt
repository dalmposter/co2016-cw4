I declared some other classes within Example3D to make it easier to run it.
Included is a batch and shell script which will compile and run my coursework submission on windows/linux respectively.
Alternatively you can use a terminal to manually compile and run it.

For the best viewing angles I suggest (from the initial position) zooming in and out
In addition you can get a nice view by rotating the system such that you are looking down on the planets orbits
The collision events surrounding rocket1 toggle quite a potent ambient light so one can see the lighting/shadows in effect better (when ambient light is off)
Or one can see the materials and textures a bit better (when the ambient light is on)
